# Contributing to Predictive Maintenance with ML

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** - Search the [Issues](https://github.com/harshitaphadtare/predictive-maintenance/issues) page to see if the bug has already been reported.

2. **Create a new issue** - If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new issue with:
   - Clear and descriptive title
   - Detailed description of the bug
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment information (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check existing issues** - Search for similar feature requests
2. **Create a feature request** - Describe the enhancement and its benefits
3. **Provide use cases** - Explain how this would be useful

### Code Contributions

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Guidelines

##### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check code style
flake8 src/ tests/
```

##### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

##### Documentation

- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Update README.md if needed
- Include examples for new features

##### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add support for FD002 dataset"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix stuff"
```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows the style guidelines**
2. **Add tests for new functionality**
3. **Update documentation if needed**
4. **Push your changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots if UI changes
